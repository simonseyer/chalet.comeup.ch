    The Berner Oberland has a lot of beautiful flying spots and our flat
    Gasseguetly is right in the middle. From the balcony you can see two
    mountains with starting spots Hornberg and Wispile.
  cableCars: >-
    The starting points of the Wispile and the Hornberg can be easily reached
    with a mountain railway. 

    The valley station of the Wispile mountain railway is in Gstaad, which can
    also be reached by train.

    The Wispile is a very beautiful mountain for slides, soars on slopes and
    offers a connection to go on a route. 

    It has starting points to the south (below the mountain station), to the
    west (left of the mountain station, seen from the station) and east (for
    this you have to go up the hill that you look at when you come out of the
    station). 

    In the morning you can usually fly from the east with the valley wind, but
    you should be careful after 12 noon because the risk of drowning increases
    in the eastern valley (the landing site is in the northwest).

    The Hornberg with the Horneggli and the Hornflue offer official starting
    points to the north and west. 

    The best place to land is Schönried im Moos, not far from the apartment or,
    if it is good, even directly above the parking lot behind the house. 

    Beautiful soaring flights can be experienced in the evenings.

  meteomediaLink: Saanen weather station
  meteomediaText: >-
    This weather station is located in Saanen and therefore primarily shows the
    wind in the west-east valley. 

    The information from this can be of interest for landings in this valley,
    e.g. 

    at landings in Schönried.

    A look at the weather station in the south on the mountain Les Diablerets
    can help with the foehn assessment.

  text: >-
    In order to evaluate the flying weather, we offer various sources and links
    that we use ourselves. 

    The weather in the Saanen valley can be strongly influenced by the Bisewind
    and the southern foehn, so a look at this should not be missing. 

    Of course, an evaluation of the weather is done at your own risk and other
    sources or your own sources should be used.
