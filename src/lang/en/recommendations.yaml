      For a coffee and a piece of cake in the afternoon, we like to go to Cafe
      Bärgsunne. 

      You can sit outside in the sun and enjoy the hospitality.

      a pizza to take home.

  kernen:
    favorite1: Edwin’s house burger - a pleasure with raclette cheese
    favorite2: The alpine rösti - the Swiss specialty
    text1: >-
      We like to go to the Hotel Kernen for dinner. 

      There is a varied menu with Swiss specialties, vegetarian dishes and
      tempting desserts. 

      We particularly appreciate the rustic ambience, especially in summer on
      the terrace with a view of the Horneggli and the Wispile, as well as the
      friendly service.

shopping:
  bakery:
    favorite1: The nut fritters - the perfect afternoon coffee snack
    favorite2: >-
      The pizza from the freezer - really delicious if you don't want to cook
      yourself
    text1: >-
      The bakery in Schönried not only offers delicious baked goods but is also
      the local supermarket. 

      It's cheaper at Coop or Migros in Gstaad, but definitely recommended for
      spontaneous shopping.

      If you are looking for bread rolls, we actually recommend the dairy. 
      They are a little bigger and we like them better.

      Unfortunately, the opening times cannot be found online, but the shops are
      generally closed for lunch and on Sundays.

  butcher:
    favorite1: The mixed salad - already plucked and washed
    favorite2: 'The salad sauce - it has it all, but it is also really delicious'
    text1: >-
      Even if we don't eat meat often, we can say that the local butcher also
      has offers of great quality. 

      And we like to go there not only for meat, but also for fresh vegetables.

      The local dairy alone is a reason to come to Schönried. 

      Every morning the farmers bring the fresh milk, which is processed into
      simply excellent products.

  supermarket:

      For general needs, we recommend a shopping trip to Gstaad. 

      There are branches of the two large Swiss supermarket chains in the form
      of Coop and Migros, in which you can shop relatively cheaply. 

      In addition, it is always nice to stroll through the Gstaadter pedestrian
      zone with further shopping opportunities.
    text2: >-
      The easiest way to get to Gstaad is by train in a few minutes. 

      You can not only enjoy the Swiss railway culture but also breathtaking
      views. 

      Highly recommended. 

      Otherwise you don't need much more than 10 minutes by car to Gstaad. 

      And if the weather is inviting, you can also walk a distance very well.
