          <h2>First Aid & Fire Extinguisher</h2>
          <p>The first aid kit can be found in the chest of drawers in the living room.  First drawer from the right. The fire extinguisher is left of the fireplace.
</p>

          <h2>Shutters</h2>
          <p>If the shutters are closed when you arrive, simply fold them out and lock them.  On departure you are welcome to leave the shutters open.
</p>

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>We are very happy to receive feedback on your stay.  No matter if it is about the AirBnB review or as a message to us.  Please let us know if there was any damage on your arrival,  if you've broken something or if you have ideas,  how we can make the accommodation even better.
</p>

          <h2>TV</h2>
          <p>With the Smart TV you can easily watch your favourite shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video  or consume any other content via the apps or browser.  It also supports AirPlay and Google Cast - when you're on WiFi, you can easily watch content to the television set.
</p>
          <p>For easier control, we can also recommend using the LG TV Plus App as a remote control  to use. The TV has no cable connection - that's why he says it is "not programmed".  Before you leave, remember to log out of your accounts.
</p>

          <h2>Glasses, Fondue & Raclette</h2>
          <p>Besides the kitchen you will find more glasses in the chest of drawers in the kitchen.  There you can find the caquelon for fondue and the raclette machine.
</p>

          <h2>contact</h2>
          <p>If you have any questions or problems we are of course here for you. Contact us either via the AirBnB App or use the contact option <a href="contact.html"> on this page</a>.
</p>

          <h2>Garbage</h2>
          <p>Please separate the waste on site. The small trash can in the living room is for paper and cardboard, everything else you can throw it in the trash can in the kitchen. Simply place glass/bottles under the sink.
</p>
          <p>Please note that only refuse bags that have to be paid for can be disposed of. Therefore use the garbage bags on the spot, if you guys take out the trash yourselves.

          </a>          
          <p>There is a parking space in the underground car park which you can use. If you stand in front of the house,  just drive back towards the main road and take the first driveway on the left (1st on the map)  The apartment key fits into the lower lock of the column and opens the gate.

          <p>The parking space is approximately in the middle of the left side and marked with the number 23 (apartment 7). Through the door next to the parking lot you can enter the staircase. If you arrived with more than one car, you can also use the free parking lot opposite the apartment (2. on the map).

          <h2>Keys</h2>
          <p>You can find the key in the key safe next to the entrance. It is the second one from the EMIUP brand. The key closes the front door of the house and apartment, the underground garage door and the ski room. When you leave, please leave the key in the safe.  This is also recommended if you leave the apartment during your stay (especially for groups).
</p>

          <h2>Ski Room</h2>
          <p>Please leave your ski and snowboard equipment in the ski room. Not with your ski boots through the staircase go! Right of the entrance you'll find the stairs leading to the ski room.
</p>

          <h2>Sink</h2>
          <p>We are happy if you wash your dishes directly, so that no dirt can settle.
